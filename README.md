# NoSQL-InterfaceReleasing=========* Run the tests and ensure they all pass* Update CHANGELOG.rst* Update the version in ``cassandra/__init__.py``* Commit the changelog and version changes* Tag the release.  For example: ``git tag -a 1.0.0 -m 'version 1.0.0'``* Push the commit and tag: ``git push --tags origin master``* Upload the package to pypi::
    python setup.py register    python setup.py sdist upload
* Update the docs (see below)* Add a '+' to the version in ``cassandra/__init__.py`` so that it looks  like ``x.y.z+``* Commit and push
Running the Tests=================In order for the extensions to be built and used in the test, run::
    python setup.py nosetests
Building the Docs=================Sphinx is required to build the docs. You probably want to install through apt,if possible::
    sudo apt-get install python-sphinx
pip may also work::
    sudo pip install -U Sphinx
To build the docs, run::
    python setup.py doc
To upload the docs, checkout the ``gh-pages`` branch (it's usually easier toclone a second copy of this repo and leave it on that branch) and copy the entirecontents all of ``docs/_build/X.Y.Z/*`` into the root of the ``gh-pages`` branchand then push that branch to github.
For example::
    python setup.py doc    cp -R docs/_build/1.0.0-beta1/* ~/python-driver-docs/    cd ~/python-driver-docs    git push origin gh-pages
